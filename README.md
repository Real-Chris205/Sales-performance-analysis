# JayClassic Store Sales Performance Analysis (2006–2009)
## Project Summary
This project evaluates revenue performance, profitability, seasonality, customer segmentation, and product contribution between 2006 and 2009. The objective was to identify primary revenue drivers, assess operational consistency, and uncover strategic growth opportunities.
The business operates with a strong 41% profit margin and demonstrates clear second-half seasonality. A significant revenue surge in 2008 was driven by transaction volume expansion, particularly within high-frequency accessory products. Daily demand intensity remains stable across weekdays and weekends, suggesting operational consistency throughout the week.
